# How to Build an AI Model from Scratch

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to building a simple AI model from scratch using PyTorch and a sample dataset. The focus of this project is to show how to preprocess data, define a neural network, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Overview
This project walks you through the process of creating a basic AI model for predicting salary based on position level. The following steps are involved:

- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the sample dataset.
- **Model Building**: Define a simple neural network architecture using PyTorch.
- **Training**: Train the model using gradient descent optimization.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
- **Visualization**: Plot the results to understand the model's predictions.

## Project Structure

- ðŸ“„ Position_Salaries.csv  : Sample dataset used for training the AI model.
- ðŸ“„ AI_Model.ipynb         : Jupyter notebook with all steps for building and training the model.


## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- **PyTorch**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting the data and model predictions.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data splitting and other utilities.

### Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install torch pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict salaries based on new position levels. You can further improve the model by experimenting with additional features, more complex neural network architectures, or other machine learning models.

## Next Steps
- Try adding more data to see how the model performs with a larger dataset.
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Gradient Boosting.
- Modify the neural network architecture to improve performance.
